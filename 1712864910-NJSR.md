# Potential for misuse of health data

Especially minorities like Ashkenazi Jews and persecuted citizens are at risk from unauthorized access to health information. Ultimately, the intangible effects of psychological duress to these patients whose data was leaked can be immeasurable. The potential consequences of such breaches can be unforeseen and the erosion of trust in an establishment like the health sector can be detrimental to even those unaffected by the breach. This may lead to patients voluntarily withholding potentially life-saving information from medical professionals delaying much needed patient care.

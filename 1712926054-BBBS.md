# Targeted Education and Reinforcement

The biggest complaint from critics in the 23andme disaster, is the lack of transparency. The company could have done more to inform users about the potential risks, what they were signing up for and the measures that the users can take to prevent these risks from materializing. Additional checks can be integrated into the system to verify that these preventive measures have been implemented from the user side.

From an organisational perspective, staff must be trained in cyber security and preventive measures must be stressed. To prevent organisational credentials from being compromised, it is vital for staff to undergo training on phishing attempts, password hygiene and to avoid password recycling across accounts. Organisations may even consider opting for physical key devices for multi-factor authentication.

Safety training at airports happen regularly, every few months. This highlights the importance of reinforcement of safety procedures in life critical environments. Cybersecurity is no different, it is vital to run regular phishing simulations, awareness campaigns and updates on the latest techniques employed by threat actors.

Businesses often are reluctant to include security training as they see them as cost centers and hence non-profitable. Oftentimes, it is the opposite case, where 80% of employees after a strong cybersecurity training program conducted regularly show a significant decrease in likelihood of falling for a phishing scam or social engineering attempt (‘2020 State of the Phish: An in-depth look at user awareness, vulnerability and resilience’, 2021). Additionally, such training programs set up convenient procedures for users and employees to report suspicious behavior when spotting it.

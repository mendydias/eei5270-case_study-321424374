# Value in compromised credential sets

Credential stuffing is also well established in the hacker economy. Rather than profit off the compromised account directly, money is made and risk of discovery is passed on to other threat actors at a more beneficial rate. A recent trend observed in the cybersecurity space, which this phenomenon is a direct example of, is the ongoing specialisation of threat actors. That is, some threat actors will specialise in gaining access while others specialize in using the compromised accounts in committing fraud.

These attacks have cemented their place in the hacker economy, such that accounts have a well-established commodity price. For example, financial accounts like PayPal may go for $30 to $120 depending on the amount of money in the account already (Dark Web Price Index 2021 - Dark Web Prices of Personal Data, 2021).

Financial accounts are not the only compromised accounts for sale, social media accounts are also available for sale. These accounts may be used to spread malware or for phishing campaigns as well as astroturfing campaigns, where a marketing or public relations campaign is conducted under the guise of unsolicited comments by the general public.

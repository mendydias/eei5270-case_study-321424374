# 23andme Concept and Inception

6.9 million users at risk and general public trust eroded in what was once a
beacon of innovation. In light of recent events, it is important to understand
what really happened, what circumstances allowed such an agregious opportunity
and how we can contain or mitigate such risks going forward. Before we really
explore into the crux of the matter, let's take a quick refresher on the context
of this disaster.

Hailed as the "Invention of the year" by the Time magazine in 2008, 23andme was
a pivotal entrepreneur in the consumer genetics industry. Born of Sillicon
valley blood, to a father who served as a professor at Stanford university and a
mother who taught some of the greatest technical minds to emerge in the 21st
century, Anne Wojcicki took on the bet of providing direct-to-consumer genetics
testing with the help of Linda Avey and Paul Cusenza. This bet paid off as the
company hit the ground running and peaked at a market cap of almost 6 billion US
dollars around 2021.

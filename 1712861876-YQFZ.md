# How it works

As previously stated, the concept is simple. Threat actors use stolen credentials from previous data breaches or purchased from the dark web. They use these credentials with automation on the presumption that people are very likely to reuse the same password across services. The major difference between this and a brute force attack is that in a traditional brute force attack, different combinations of characters are tested until the correct combination is found, while credential stuffing involves finding the correct combination of usernames and passwords.

As the number of stolen credentials to check against is usually large and the time taken for brute force attacks scales with input, automation plays a crucial role in this form of cyber attack. Botnets are used extensively, which are networks of compromised computers to automate the task of testing combinations of usernames and passwords. Depending on the size of the botnet used, this allows the threat actor to quickly and reliably assess a large number of credentials over a brief period of time.

There are two phases in a credential stuffing attack:

  - [[1712898136-NNLI|Exploitation]]

Understanding the two phases is extremely useful, as it provides two attack surfaces which can be separately addressed to mitigate future risk of such attacks.

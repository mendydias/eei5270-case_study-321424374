# Violation of privacy

The information should, but doesn't to a satisfying degree, embrace the principles of transparency. Many telehealth, direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies don't disclose the unique tradeoffs that consumers make when signing up for these services. Consumers often spend a premium on these services and are then suprised to find that the company not only profits from the provided service but also the mined data.

Additionally, when data is not stored securely and internal access control mechanisms are not provided, unauthorized access may be given to threat actors to sensitive medical records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and genetic information.

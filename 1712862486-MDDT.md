# Discovery and action taken

On the 10th of October, with the formal statement acknowledging the attack, 23andme promptly required all users to reset their password.

On the 20th of October, the company disabled several prominent features from the Relatives feature to prevent such an attack from reoccurring.

On the 6th of November, all existing and new customers of the company were migrated to a two-factor authentication system, either through email or through an authentication app.

On the 1st of December, the investigation into the attack was concluded with the verdict that the attack was a form of mass credential stuffing.

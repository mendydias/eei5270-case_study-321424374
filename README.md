## Key Lessons and Conclusion

23andMe suffered a devastating data breach in October, 2023 where attackers used the "Credential stuffing" technique to scrape the data of upto 7 million users, critically violating the privacy of all these users. The lessons learned upon the completion of the investigation are the vital importance of strong authentication practices, especially multi-factor authentication (MFA), the dangers of credential recycling and the importance of awareness training. The unique sensitivity of genetic data which exposes both the direct owner as well as the related individuals and the politicized nature of the exploit complicates the situation for the healthcare industry. The need has been identified, for a series of strong, united, defensive measures for the health care sector to fight off the inevitable horde of threat actors focused on exploiting the vulnerable for money. It is no longer enough, that companies are reactive to the attacks from hackers; that is rather than wait to implement MFA after an attack, better to take a proactive approach. It is also important to review the level of trust placed on passwords and to take on more accountability and responsibility for user health information as it is clearly shown to be a highly profitable industry. The hope going forward is that such needless disasters are prevented in the future by following security best practices, adopting zero-trust policies and staying up to date in an ever-changing threat landscape.

# Competitive pressures

2023 was the year, where the most interest was shown in the use of DNA testing. Both 23andme and Ancestry.com grew in userbase amassing a vast amount of DNA data. After the data breach, use of 23andme has decreased and users have started to diversify in their reliance on companies to test their DNA. Other companies capitalizing on the same opportunities that 23andme focus on, have had an easier time approaching the market while 23andme has been tied up in legal and regulatory troubles (23andMe Reports FY2023 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results | 23andMe, Inc.).

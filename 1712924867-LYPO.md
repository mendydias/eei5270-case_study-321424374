# Strong password policies

Updating the password requirements for both new and existing users will be extremely helpful so that unique passwords with strong lengths (to prevent character or dictionary brute force attacks) and mixed character combinations will hold up better against these types of attacks.

Uniqueness can also be mandated using password management tools to generate the password for you. This alleviates the cognitive load of having to remember the password. The main reason for password recycling is that it is difficult to remember many unique passwords for many different services. These tools help manage your passwords such that you don't have to remember more than one.

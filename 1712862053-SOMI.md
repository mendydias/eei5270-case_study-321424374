# Weakness of 23andme security measures

The vulnerability wasn't just the existence of the compromised accounts, but also a wide range of security complacencies from 23andme which allowed the two step process of credential stuffing to take place. Despite what the company claims in the defense built by their lawyers, there was significant bad cyber hygiene which lead to the attackers accessing a large data set instead of being foiled at the very beginning or limited to a smaller set of accounts once the pattern was identified.

Until the breach occurred, the login process had no rate limiting, ip block lists, and account login timeouts. These measures are used from the server side to prevent the threat actor from abusing automation to make many requests or attempts at trying the credential combinations. Ideally, the service should detect abnormal login rates at high frequencies and should try to limit or block the traffic coming from the specific computer or region. A very commonly used limiting tactic is to timeout multiple logins for a specific duration to deincentivize repeated login attempts.

Lack of multi-factor authentication mechanisms also provided vital in deterring this sort of attack. The lack of initiative on the company's part to alert the users on potential risks of recycling logins was also not conducted. The major contributing factor was the unawareness of the regular user about such risks and risks of using the products and services offered by the company.

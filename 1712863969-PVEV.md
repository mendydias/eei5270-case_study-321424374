# Customer concerns

Especially in the information industry, these types of attacks highlight a key risk that organizations must address. Sensitive consumer data, when exposed without consent, will lead to serious violations of privacy and the erosion of public goodwill and trust. Consumers may feel vulnerable that their locations, identification, etc., may be in nefarious hands, especially minorities facing the danger of persecution. Furthermore, this kind of data breach results in feeling like the users have lost control of their own data.

Immediate impacts on the consumer's wellbeing may be due to employers, governments, insurance companies, or others that may use the information in an unfair manner, often to refuse services or jobs based on certain information that must be private. Additionally, this information could lead to blackmail, identity theft, persecution and further social engineering to commit fraud.

The biological relatives of the compromised users, who may not have even used the 23andme service, may now face the same threats as the users themselves. Their data and information which was derived involuntarily may also be compromised. There have been cases, where families of political members or individuals wanted by governments have been hunted down using genomic information; thus endangering whole demographics.

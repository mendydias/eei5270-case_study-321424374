# Sensitivity of the data

The essential challenge with genetic data is the information it may contain,
including ethnicity and health-related information, together with the potential
for reidentification (Sariyar, Suhr and Schl√ºnder, 2017). This is because DNA is
like a unique identifier, much like an identification number, but unlike other
unique identifiers which can be regenerated and reassigned, this identifier
cannot be changed and will identify the relevant person until death, i.e.
irrevocable.

The misuse of such information in the form of targeted exploitation,
discrimination, or other unforeseen consequences can not only affect the
individual but also the biological relatives of the individuals regardless of
whether the individuals are aware of each other's existence or the fact that
they are related. This can compound the privacy concern as the related
individuals may not even be aware of their data being collected as it can be
inferred through sufficient samples. To put this in context, a carefully chosen
set of 45 single nucleotide polymorphisms is more than enough to identify an
individual to an error of 10^-15 (Pakstis et al., 2007).

While the protection of sensitive data, including genomic, is covered in
legislation like the EU GDPR, the vast majority of consumers are unaware of the
implications of data breaches and the services or products at offer by these
companies.

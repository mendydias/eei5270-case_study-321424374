# Indirect financial costs

Companies like GSK (formerly GlaxoSmithKlein) depend on the data that 23andme and other similar companies collect for research and development of drug cures for genetically linked diseases. Breaches lead to disruption of healthcare and delays in patient care as the information that other pharmaceutical companies depend on may be tied up in legal trouble.

Productivity of employees will be lost, due to incident response, recovery and containment efforts. The stigma that follows from public scrutiny may also lead to an uptick in employee burnout and turnover. Especially those engineers in charge of security and authentication will be under strain from investigative efforts. Thus, the damaged reputation will further hinder the attraction of future investors and cash inflow, as well as the hiring of talent due to the lack of cash to maintain high labor costs and the social stigma surrounding the company.

# The nature of the breach

In early October of 2023, 23andme officially filed a report with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), USA, that they had identified that a large amount
of data from individual user accounts had been compromised and scraped by a
threat actor. This information was then sold online through the use of various
of black-hat (hacking for nefarious purposes) forums.

Investigations into the event began and subsequently revealed that the attack
had been the result of a "credential stuffing" technique employed by the threat
actor. This was disclosed to the public, which resulted in an immediate loss of
trust, and followed up with updates on the company's official blog as the
investigation progressed.

# Attack Timeline

In August 2023, the threat actor known as Golem on Breach Forums, claimed to have stolen 300 TB of 23andme data.

On the 10th of October 2023, the company confirmed that their data had indeed been compromised. Stolen data emerged that verified that the data indeed matched the certain users' public geneology. 

The attackers seemed to have primarily targeted individuals of Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese descent.  The kind of data that was leaked, like the name, photograph, etc. left the attack with a highly politicised undertone. That is to say, that experts believed the attack to be racially and politically motivated.

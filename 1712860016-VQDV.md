# Role in the consumer genetics industry

The company was innovative as the then-cost of getting a DNA test was
prohibitive for most consumers to reap the countless interesting discoveries and
benefits of knowing one's DNA sequence can provide and and building a
comprehensive genetical database was missed out on. The basic concept was
simple. The idea was to give people access to their genetic information while
collecting this information at the same time for research purposes. Consumers
would consent and participate with the program by providing samples of saliva,
which would then go through autosomal analysis (which itself was a pioneering
technique soon to be adopted by all other similar companies soon after) to
provide important genetic information like ancestral, health and train
information.

Since the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, wherein the entire
human genome was sequenced, base pairs mapped from both a physical and
functional standpoint, the cost of personal genomics has gone down
exponentially, thanks to the contributions of companies like 23andme to the
industry. Thanks to these organisations, the cost of sequencing an individuals
DNA has gone down to 1000 US dollars, and even 100 US dollars at the peak of the
company's existence.

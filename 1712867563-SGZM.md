# Technical safeguards

It is difficult to correctly verify that user login activity/traffic is friendly and not nefarious. This makes credential stuffing attacks difficult to monitor.

However, systems like intrusion detection and prevention systems can still help look for early signs of a potential attack. Account lockout mechanisms may also help but these are still susceptible to botnets spread across regions so that account lockout code is never triggered. Using existing information and shared threat intelligence it may be possible to identify regions or ip address ranges from which botnets commonly attack from. This is errorprone, but firewalls can be used to thus lock out entire ip address ranges.

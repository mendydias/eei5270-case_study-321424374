# User base and its growth

Starting in a small office, comprising of just the three founders, the company
grew from humble beginnings to a peak of 816 employees and 14 million users.
This meant that the company now possesses genomic data of those 14 million
users including data on those who hadn't taken the DNA test as that could be
extrapolated from the existing user data.

# Multi factor authentication

Multi factor authentication is a form of authentication which requires multiple "factors" to authenticate. This basically means that a registered device or email is required to verify the identity of the person using the account credentials.

The basic authentication flow goes like this:
1. User enters credentials
2. User receives one-time-passwords via email, sms or authenticator app
3. Entering the otp verifies the identity of the user.

Where solutions like rate limiting (limiting the amount of traffic flowing through the network so that requests cannot be made several times in a row) and ip block lists may not be as effective as the attacker may spread the attack over regional botnets (Credential Stuffing Prevention - OWASP Cheat Sheet Series), multi factor authentication stumps password based attacks. This authentication mechanism requires the user to have the secondary authentication device in person, invalidating brute force automation.

The downside is that multifactor authentication is counter intuitive to setup, impacts UX and non-techsavvy users may forego this process entirely. Convenience is usually the reciprocal of security.

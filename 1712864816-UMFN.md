# Direct financial costs

After the initial discovery in October 2023, 23andme spent considerable resources in IT, legal and public affairs, to contain the situation. The costs of halting regular operations to send notifications and messages to all customers, especially those affected.

Additionally, third party forensics and government regulators were brought in for investigation. These force regular operations to take the backseat and more money to be spent on these third parties to conduct the investigations. Additionally, as news of the event spreads, class action lawsuits by their customers were filed against the company. Legal matters such as this is also extremely expensive and the company funds took a large hit as evidenced by the annual financial report. 

Possibly other costs may be incurred for providing identity theft insurance to those affected consumers. Revenue will also be lost from these products and services due to customers leaving the company en masse and reduced patient trust. Investor confidence in the company will also reduce, leaving it to be stranded without financial support.

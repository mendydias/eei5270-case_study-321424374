# Gaining access to compromised data

Compromised credentials can be accessed from a variety of different sources, including:

1. Data breaches: one of the more common ways that credentials may be stolen.

2. Phishing attacks: a type of social engineering attack, where an attacker mimics the actions of a trusted entity using fake emails, fake login screens, etc., to take the credentials of the victim.

3. Credential leaks: from an organisational perspective, the security infrastructure could be flawed in that sensitive information is stored in plain text or using insecure processes. This could result in the unintentional or intentional leaking of the credentials.

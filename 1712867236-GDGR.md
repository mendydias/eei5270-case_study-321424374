# User education and awareness

The biggest complaint from critics in the 23andme disaster, is the lack of transparency. The company could have done more to inform users about the potential risks, what they were signing up for and the measures that the users can take to prevent these risks from materializing. Additional checks can be integrated into the system to verify that these preventive measures have been implemented from the user side.

From an organisational perspective, staff must be trained in cyber security and preventive measures must be stressed. To prevent organisational credentials from being compromised, it is vital for staff to undergo training on phishing attempts, password hygiene and to avoid password recycling across accounts. Organisations may even consider opting for physical key devices for multi-factor authentication.

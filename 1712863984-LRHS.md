# Reputational damage

Regardless of whether 23andme feel that they have done no wrong and that the attack wasn't their fault, the public scrutiny has severly tarnished the reputation of the company. Once hailed as the invention of the century by the Times magazine, the erosion of public trust has weighed heavily on the company.

The company stock once valued at $6 billion at market cap, is now at the danger of being delisted from NASDAQ as the company is being hit with multiple lawsuits from the 7 million users affected from the data breach (23andMe Blames Users for Recent Data Breach as Itâ€™s Hit With Dozens of Lawsuits | WIRED).

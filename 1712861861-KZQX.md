# Understanding credential stuffing

Credential stuffing is the term given to a cyber attack, where a threat actor takes a list of stolen usernames and passwords from a previous breach and uses it to access online user accounts. More often is the case that the obtained usernames and passwords are not paired and requires automation to try several pairs of credentials until a successful match is obtained; thus credential stuffing is a type of brute force attack.

Data from sources like SpyCloud indicate that more than 64% of users recycle credentials across online services, which makes these users more prone to successful credential stuffing attacks. Over 80% of the cyber attacks of this decade has been from credential stuffing (2024 Data Breach Investigations Report | Verizon, no date), making this technique one of the most common causes of data breaches. This vulnerability is further excacerbated by the fact that common prevention measures like password strength are ineffective to these types of attacks. Additionally the threat vector is further elevated in risk potential by the fact that if one of the credentials is an organisational credential, then the attack is further disruptive.
